**Khizer Zakir**
*PhD Researcher | GeoDataScience | Climate, Communities & Change*

High in the breathtaking Pamir mountains—where the clouds kiss the peaks and resilience is a way of life—Khizer Zakir began a journey that has since spanned continents, cultures, and coastlines.

A proud graduate of the University of Central Asia, Khizer discovered more than just academic knowledge in one of the world’s most remote regions—he found perspective. “It teaches you patience,” he reflects, “and how to listen to the silence.”

Fuelled by a fascination with landscapes—both physical and digital—Khizer earned a fully funded ERASMUS scholarship to study GeoDataScience. His academic path took him from the Alps of Salzburg to the shores of Bretagne, France, where he learned to build geospatial models while soaking in sunsets over the Atlantic.

Beyond the classroom, Khizer has traveled to over ten countries, picking up languages and cultural insight, and participating in international projects that blend technology, environmental science, and local wisdom. His work explores how data can drive meaningful change and how maps can tell deeply human stories.

He has:
✅ Published two peer-reviewed research articles
✅ Been featured in an AWS Success Story for cloud-based geospatial innovation
✅ Presented at dozens of international conferences and summer schools

Today, Khizer is pursuing a PhD at the University of Salzburg, with a research focus on climate, communities, and change. Grounded yet globally minded, he brings curiosity, calm, and quiet confidence to every step of his journey.

“I have high hopes,” he says, “but I don’t rush things. I just like to play along as life unfolds. It’s been kind to me so far.”
